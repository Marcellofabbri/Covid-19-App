# COVID-19 APP

An app for latest updates on the Coronavirus epidemic.



# Project's story and evolution

This is my first personal side project after completing the Makers Bootcamp in London in March 2020. It's an idea I had for our final project that I couldn't realize, as it had not been picked up, so I started working on it on my own after the end of the course.



## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook)

[online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.
